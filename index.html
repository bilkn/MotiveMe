              Success is something everyone wants, like answering yes to the
              question of whether you would like a million dollars. However, one
              of the things that makes success a success is that it is not
              immediately available. The road to success is a long road, and
              perseverance, persistence, and problem-solving skills are essential
              to complete this journey. Many people only dream of going this
              road, be the ones who set off, not the ones who dream.

            <h4 class="story__name">The Elephant Rope</h4>
            <p class="story__text">
              A gentleman was walking through an elephant camp, and he spotted
              that the elephants weren’t being kept in cages or held by the use
              of chains. All that was holding them back from escaping the camp,
              was a small piece of rope tied to one of their legs. As the man
              gazed upon the elephants, he was completely confused as to why the
              elephants didn’t just use their strength to break the rope and
              escape the camp. They could easily have done so, but instead, they
              didn’t try to at all.
              <br />
              <br />
              Curious and wanting to know the answer, he asked a trainer nearby
              why the elephants were just standing there and never tried to
              escape. The trainer replied; “when they are very young and much
              smaller we use the same size rope to tie them and, at that age,
              it’s enough to hold them. As they grow up, they are conditioned to
              believe they cannot break away. They believe the rope can still
              hold them, so they never try to break free.”
              <br />
              <br />
              The only reason that the elephants weren’t breaking free and
              escaping from the camp was that over time they adopted the belief
              that it just wasn’t possible.

            <p class="story__text">
              Colonel Sanders has one of the most motivational success stories
              Earning his place on this best motivational stories list is KFC’s
              Colonel Harland Sanders. Sanders worked a number of jobs, such as
              a steam engine stoker, filling station operator and an insurance
              salesman, but it wasn’t until his time running his restaurant in
              Kentucky that he made what would make him famous. While there, he
              developed his secret recipe and method of cooking chicken.
              <br />
              <br />
              Sanders proceeded to go around USA trying to sell his chicken
              recipe to restaurants. His idea was to give them the recipe for
              free and then take a percentage on each chicken dish sold. Colonel
              Sanders was rejected 1009 times before he got his first “yes”.
              Colonel Sanders proves that sometimes you just need to keep going
              if you want to be successful.

            <h4 class="story__name">Oprah Winfrey</h4>
            <p class="story__text">
              Oprah Winfrey’s story is one big inspirational message
              Oprah Winfrey has built a billion-dollar empire, and, in 2017, was placed 1st on Forbes’ list of America’s richest female entertainers.
              <br />
              <br />
              But life was not easy for Oprah growing up, and she went through a great deal of adversity to have this real life inspirational success story.
              You see, Winfrey originally grew up in Mississippi with her grandmother before she was sent to live with her mother in Wisconsin when she was 6. This move was disruptive and she felt alone and abandoned. But, before she could get comfortable in Wisconsin, she was sent to live with her father in Tennessee, before moving back to live with her mother again.
              <br />
              <br />
              During this time, Winfrey was abused by her family members. Her grandmother whipped her, leaving her with welts over her body. When she was 9 years old, a 19 year old cousin of hers raped her. She was also sexually assaulted by other relatives between the ages of 10 and 14. Winfrey became pregnant aged 14 and considered committing suicide. Ultimately, the baby was born prematurely and died in the hospital. Winfrey knew this was her second chance at life.
              Despite her difficult childhood, Winfrey went on to become one of the most powerful women in in the world and is an inspiration to the world.
